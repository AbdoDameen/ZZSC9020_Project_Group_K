Abstract: 'A first assessed activity will be the Group Project Plan (20%). The first
  step is to delimit the problem which will be studied. You should understand and
  define your own overall problem and propose a solution. Having only a short time
  to complete the project, it  is crucial that the problem that will be studied is
  well defined. The approach to solve the problem should be original, so it will be
  necessary to carry out a preliminary literature review. This will prevent any plagiarism.
  This will also enable you to situate the project in a more global context. At this
  stage, one can identify potential approaches and software that will be used to solve
  the problem. It is necessary to plan any simulation carefully and to decide what
  statistical analyses will have to be carried out. All the sub-steps of the project
  should be planned precisely (a detailed schedule will be created). A kind of short
  draft version of your final report, consisting of a three-page proposal (excluding
  the mandatory pages devoted to the title, abstract, contents and references) will
  be submitted and discussed with one of the instructors at the end of Week 1 or in
  a clear definition of the problem you plan to study; a clear description of the data 
  format and their storage; a clear description of the relevant data (variables, missing 
  and corrupt values, etc.); the level of difficulty of the chosen data sets (size, complexity,
  messiness) and its relevance for the chosen problem; the appropriate choice of software
  and statistical methods to solve your research questions; a clear description of
  the role of each team member with a proper justification; the precision of your
  scheduled activities.'

## Introduction and Motivation {.label:s-intro}

You should describe the problem in your own words and motivate its importance. Your description should be clear for a reader not familiar with the problem (e.g., a student in your discipline but who is not involved in the course, another professor from your school who is not teaching this course). The idea is that you explain clearly what you have understood about what exactly is the problem after having listened to the project provider, and after potential discussions with the sponsor and/or your lecturers. Each team can define its own specific problem in the context of the global problem and associated data sets provided by the "client".

\bigskip

Then, briefly describe how you intend to solve the problem (e.g., compare several existing methodologies, apply specific statistical techniques, etc.).

## Brief Literature Review

Survey the most related work you have found in the literature. Due to space restrictions, describe only the most relevant work and discuss its connections to your work. Describe the methods employed in the related work, as well as the employed measure of success.



\bigskip

In order to incorporate your own references in this report, we strongly advise you use BibTeX. Your references then need to be recorded in the file `references.bib`, and cited as follows @Lafaye2013.

## Methods, Software and Data Description

You should describe the techniques you intend to use and why
you have selected these techniques. Also, describe the software and libraries that you will need to implement
your analyses. You can revise this later since this is an initial proposal. Finally, provide a clear description of
the relevant data (format, storage, variables, messiness, size, complexity) and its relevance for the chosen problem.

## Activities and Schedule

List the main project activities and create a timetable for the activities. You can use a Gantt Chart (see next page). Describe the roles of all team members with proper justification.
