# Welcome to ZZSC9020 GitHub repository for Group K

This GitHub repository is the main point of access for team members of Group K and lecturers of the ZZSC9020 capstone course. 

In this repository, you will find the data that are used in this project. Also, we will use the repository to share code, documentation, data, models and other resources between the group members and course lecturers.

### Brief project description

The supply and demand of energy are volatile. For suppliers to enter and remain in the market, the supply of energy must be profitable. Profitability hinges on accurately predicting and providing the most efficient amount of energy to the grid. It is a known fact that weather plays a significant role in energy demand. For instance, heating is utilized when the temperature drops, and air conditioning is used when the temperature rises. Therefore, this analysis will examine the impact of weather on energy demand to better predict the required supply. If the supply is not accurately calculated, suppliers may incur excessive costs to provide additional energy. Given the substantial role of weather in energy demand, the analysis will also consider the effects of global warming and erratic storm periods. Other factors also influence the supply and demand of energy. This project will attempt to identify the patterns that daily and seasonal variations, as well as holidays, have on demand. Incorporating all these factors into an analysis of energy demand will highlight the advantages of using a machine learning model to predict demand more efficiently.
