  abstract = {The environmental issues we are currently facing require long-term prospective efforts for sustainable growth. Renewable energy sources seem to be one of the most practical and efficient alternatives in this regard. Understanding a nation&rsquo;s pattern of energy use and renewable energy production is crucial for developing strategic plans. No previous study has been performed to explore the dynamics of power consumption with the change in renewable energy production on a country-wide scale. In contrast, a number of deep learning algorithms have demonstrated acceptable performance while handling sequential data in the era of data-driven predictions. In this study, we developed a scheme to investigate and predict total power consumption and renewable energy production time series for eleven years of data using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The dynamics of the interaction between the total annual power consumption and renewable energy production were investigated through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a feature engineering framework. The performance of the model was found to be satisfactory through the comparison of the predicted data with the observed data, the visualization of the distribution of the errors and root mean squared error (RMSE), and the R2 values of 0.084 and 0.82. Higher performance was achieved by increasing the number of epochs and hyperparameter tuning. The proposed framework has the potential to be used and transferred to investigate the trend of renewable energy production and power consumption and predict future scenarios for different communities. The incorporation of a cloud-based platform into the proposed pipeline to perform predictive studies from data acquisition to outcome generation may lead to real-time forecasting.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the internal energy consumption on the Internet of Things (IoT) has been studied. The purpose of this paper is to predict the factors affecting energy consumption in buildings by considering machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Ada boost, random forest and neural network. These algorithms are implemented in the Orange tool. Also, the univariate regression algorithm is used to select the best feature. This algorithm determines the most important factors affecting energy consumption and their impact. Then, with the help of Gephi tool, these data are simulated in the IoT environment as a complex network. The simulated network in the Internet of things is also a small world network. This network shows the relationships between the features. The results of this paper show that the overall height, roof area, surface area and relative compaction have the greatest impact on the energy consumption of buildings. It can be seen that the predicted error percentages for these data for cooling loads and heating loads are 0.911 and 0.292, respectively. It should be noted that the best algorithm for cooling load and heating load is Ada boost algorithm.},

  abstract = {Energy consumption and thermal comfort in buildings are heavily affected by weather conditions. This study investigated the impact of climate change on thermal comfort conditions and on heating and cooling energy demand in dwellings in three cities in Brazil. Scenario A2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was selected to be used in the study. To quantify the impact, the Climate Change World Weather File Generator was used to produce weather data for future typical meteorological years, such as 2020, 2050 and 2080. The EnergyPlus computer programme was used to estimate the indoor air temperature and the annual heating and cooling energy demand in the future. In order to maintain the energy consumption in the houses at the level it is nowadays, passive design strategies such as solar shading, low absorptance and thermal insulation were assessed. Results show that there will be an increase in the annual energy demand ranging from 19%–65% among the three cities in 2020; 56%–112% in 2050; and 112%–185% in 2080. In the coldest city, the annual heating energy demand will decrease by 94% in 2080 due to an increase in the average temperature and global solar radiation. The use of passive design strategies may reduce up to 50% the future annual cooling and heating energy demand in houses in Brazil.},
