# Introduction {.label:s-intro}

The supply and demand of energy are volatile. For suppliers to enter and remain in the market, the supply of energy must be profitable. Profitability hinges on accurately predicting and providing the most efficient amount of energy to the grid.

It is a known fact that weather plays a significant role in energy demand. For instance, heating is utilized when the temperature drops, and air conditioning is used when the temperature rises. Therefore, this analysis will examine the impact of weather on energy demand to better predict the required supply. If the supply is not accurately calculated, suppliers may incur excessive costs to provide additional energy. Given the substantial role of weather in energy demand, the analysis will also consider the effects of global warming and erratic storm periods.

Other factors also influence the supply and demand of energy. This project will attempt to identify the patterns that daily and seasonal variations, as well as holidays, have on demand.

Incorporating all these factors into an analysis of energy demand will highlight the advantages of using a machine learning model to predict demand more efficiently.

Specifically, within the scope of this project, we will identify energy consumption patterns to uncover hidden temporal trends in demand, including daily and seasonal fluctuations. We will perform a climate impact assessment to quantify how changes in climate variables, like temperature, affect energy demand.

Additionally, we will conduct holiday and special event analysis to understand their impact on energy consumption, thereby aiding in better planning.

Based on this analysis, we will provide policy recommendations to offer actionable insights for energy policy formulation, including the diversification of energy sources to balance demand. We will create a machine learning model capable of predicting future energy demand with high accuracy, incorporating all the identified variables.


# Literature Review
The topic of how climate change impacts residential energy use has been studied in various global contexts. The first research paper investigates the potential changes in energy consumption in Europe and Australia, predicting a variable impact ranging from a 26% decrease to a whopping 350% increase by the year 2100. @Yazdan-et-al-2022-FC. Particularly, homes in Sydney have been identified as more susceptible to climate change, emphasizing the importance of geographical factors. Another study shifts the focus to Asia, particularly to five major cities in China. This research expects an increase in cooling energy demands while foreseeing a decrease in heating requirements @Fard-Hosseini-2022-ML. These trends align with the general narrative that global warming is driving cooling needs upwards. Finally, a third study zeroes in on Brazil, forecasting an upsurge in energy demands by up to 185% by 2080. However, the paper also proposes that passive design techniques could significantly mitigate these energy demands, potentially reducing annual consumption by up to 50% @Invidiata-Ghisi-2016-CC.

Collectively, these studies underline that climate change will have a substantial impact on residential and office energy demands worldwide. They stress the significance of local geographical and climatic conditions and propose passive design as a key strategy for mitigating future energy needs.

# Material and Methods

## Software

Python and R/RSudio software will be used to analyse the data. Libraries and packages such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for Python and ggplot2, dplyr, caret for R are required in this analysis. RMarkdown, knitr will also be utilized for putting the analysis together.

## Description of the Data

We will use the provided data sets as our core data for our analysis, including:

* *totaldemand_nsw.csv*: Total Demand data.

* *temperature_nsw.csv*: Temperature data.

The data will need further analysis and cleaning, including the removal of invalid and outlier data before they will be used to generate the demand forecast.

### Total Demand data

The Total Demand data provided in file *totaldemand_nsw.csv* contains energy demand in 5-minute intervals from January 1, 2010, to August 1, 2022, for New South Wales. The data is in a comma-delimited file format, with columns labeled Datetime, RegionId, and TotalDemand. The RegionId consists only of NSW1.

```{python}
# Read Total Demand data from file
demand_df = pd.read_csv('../../data/totaldemand_nsw.csv')

# Number of records in Total Demand data set
demand_df.count()

# Snippet of Total Demand data
demand_df.head(10)
```

### Temperature data

The temperature data provided in file *temperature_nsw.csv* is in 30-minute intervals from January 1, 2010, to August 1, 2022, for New South Wales. The data is provided in a comma-delimited file format, with headings DateTime, Location, and Temperature (in Celsius). The source of the temperature data is the Bankstown weather location. Invalid temperatures, such as -9999, will be removed from the analysis.

```{python}
# Read Temperature data from file
temp_df = pd.read_csv('../../data/temperature_nsw.csv')

# Number of records in Temperature data file
temp_df.count()

# Snippet of Temperature data
temp_df.head(10)

```

### Other data sets

We will use additional data sets to encrich the provided data to enhance the accuracy of demand forecast.

When merging these datasets, there will be mismatched data since the demand is in 5-minute intervals and the temperature data is in 30-minute intervals. There are approximately 1.3 million rows of demand data and 247,646 rows of temperature data; therefore, some analysis is required to map more demand data to temperature data. One possibility is to simulate temperature data for the data points that are not available.

Since this project aims to address questions regarding future energy demand, historical data will be utilized, and the datasets provided are an excellent starting point. Additional data will be sourced to enhance these datasets.


## Pre-processing Steps

The data type on the columns which contain the date time are not date time, therefore the column needs to be cast to datetime for better analysis 

```{python}
demand_df.dtypes
demand_df[['DATETIME']] = demand_df[['DATETIME']].apply(pd.to_datetime)
demand_df.dtypes
temp_df[['DATETIME']] = temp_df[['DATETIME']].apply(pd.to_datetime)
temp_df.dtypes

demand_df.describe()
temp_df.describe()
```

## Data Cleaning
*Comments from template:How did you deal with missing data? etc. *

There are temperatures which have a value of -9999. Pull this data out to investigate.

```{python}
## check values which are less than 0
temp_Less0= temp_df[temp_df['TEMPERATURE'] < 0]
temp_Less0.describe()
temp_Less0

## only leave rows where temp > -9999 which will exclude data which is -9999
temp_df= temp_df[temp_df['TEMPERATURE'] > -9999]
temp_df.describe()

```



## Assumptions

*Comments from template:What assumptions are you making on the data?*

## Modelling Methods

# Exploratory Data Analysis
```{python}
merged_df = pd.merge(demand_df, temp_df, on='DATETIME', how='inner')

merged_df.head(5)

merged_df.info()
merged_df.describe()
```

*Comments from template:This is where you explore your data using histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, numerical summaries, etc.*

Tried scatter plot and linear model plot
It is clear that the linear plot is not the best model to utilise.
```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

sns.lmplot(y="TOTALDEMAND", x="TEMPERATURE", data=merged_df, order=1)
plt.xlabel('Temp')
plt.ylabel('Demand')
plt.show()


plt.scatter(y=merged_df['TOTALDEMAND'], x=merged_df['TEMPERATURE'])
plt.show()
```

    df['HOUR'] = df.index.hour
    df['HALF_HOUR'] = df.index.minute//30
    
    return df

```


## Exploratory Data Analysis for energy "totaldemand" data

We plot demand against datetime to observe the pattern of energy demand.

```{python}
fig = px.line(tot_demand, x="DATETIME", y="TOTALDEMAND", title="Energy Demand with slider", height=600) # width
fig.update_xaxes(
    rangeslider_visible=True,
    rangeselector=dict(
        buttons=list([
            dict(count=1, label="1y", step="year", stepmode="todate"),
            dict(count=2, label="2y", step="year", stepmode="todate"),
            dict(count=3, label="3y", step="year", stepmode="todate"),
            dict(step="all")
        ])
    )
)
fig.show()

```

## Auto correlation

```{python}
# using lag_plot
pd.plotting.lag_plot(tot_demand["TOTALDEMAND"], lag=1) # 1lag = 5 mints
pd.plotting.lag_plot(tot_demand["TOTALDEMAND"], lag=12) # lag12 = 5*12= 60 mints =1hr
pd.plotting.lag_plot(tot_demand["TOTALDEMAND"], lag=12*24) # lag12*24 = 5*12*24= 1day
pd.plotting.lag_plot(tot_demand["TOTALDEMAND"], lag=12*24*365) # 1year

# Using auto correlation
pd.plotting.autocorrelation_plot(tot_demand_idx["2010":"2022"]["TOTALDEMAND"].resample("1m").mean())

# Analysis and Results

## A First Model

Having a very simple model is always good so that you can benchmark any result you would obtain with a more elaborate model.

\bigskip

For example, one can use the linear regression model

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \cdots \beta_p x_{pi} + \epsilon_i, \qquad i=1,\ldots,n.
$$
where it is assumed that the $\epsilon_i$'s are i.i.d.\ $N(0,1)$.
